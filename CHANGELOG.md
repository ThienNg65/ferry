# Changelog

All notable changes to Ferry are documented in this file, in [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) style. `package.json`'s `version` and the standalone `VERSION` file must always be bumped together.

## 0.4.0 — Round 4: UX feedback

- Centered the "Ferry" title in the title bar.
- Removed the Activity feature entirely (dock tab, backend ring buffer, IPC channel, store, component).
- Moved the hide-Local-pane toggle from the Local pane's own header into the site tab bar, pinned to the right end.
- Connecting to a saved site that already has an open tab now switches to that tab instead of opening a duplicate connection.
- The SSH terminal now opens automatically in the background as soon as a site connects, labeled `username@host`, instead of waiting for the Terminal dock tab to be clicked.
- Added a remote-only file-permissions column, with a toggle between a friendly plain-English label and the classic technical `rwxr-xr-x` string.
- Custom scrollbar styling matching the app's neutral color palette, in both light and dark mode.
- Added tooltips to every icon-only button across the app.
- Added a Ctrl+R shortcut to refresh the focused pane's directory listing.
- Shipped the app's icon/favicon assets (installer, taskbar/window icon, renderer favicon).

## 0.3.0 — Round 3: site tabs, SSH terminal, named sessions

- Browser-like site tabs — open multiple sites at once, switch between them instantly, each with its own live SSH session.
- Interactive SSH Terminal dock tab per site tab, backed by `ssh2`'s PTY shell and `@xterm/xterm`.
- Entering a saved site shows `Session {name}` instead of a raw session UUID.
- The hide-Local toggle moved into the Local pane's own header row.
- Removed the redundant "Disconnect" button/bar (closing a tab already disconnects its session).

## 0.2.0 — Round 2: saved sites, preview, and polish

- Saved sites (add/edit/delete), quick-connect, and file preview/tail dialog.
- Hide-Local-pane toggle, custom frameless titlebar, download/toast polish.

(commit `b372122`)

## 0.1.0 — Initial scaffold

- Ferry's initial SFTP client scaffold: dual-pane browser, transfer queue, and live remote log tailing.
